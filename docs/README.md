# [elements] documentation website source code

## Test with Jekyll locally

In order to test the website without having a webserver running and also see
the changes in real time use the `jekyll.sh` script to run [Jekyll] locally from
the current directory.

It requires [ruby] to be installed; [RVM] is the preferred choice for this,
the rest will be installed locally in the `.bundle` directory.

The current Gemfile configuration is set to use the same
Jekyll version as [GitHub pages].

The website will be available at <http://localhost:4000/elements/>.
